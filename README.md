# Making A Twitter Developer Account

First off we're going to need to make a Twitter Developer account to obtain an API key. If you don't have a Twitter account, you're going to need to make one. Go to apps.twitter.com and sign into your Twitter account. Afterwards, answer their few questions and prompt to create a developer account. 

Now clone the base code from Github. This is the page you're on right now. Click on the green clone and download link. 

This code uses the libraries requests and pandas, which makes it easier to make HTTP requests and to read/write csv files. In order to make this code functional, download tweepy using the command ```pip install requests``` and then ```pip install pandas``` in the terminal.


## Starting to Code!

Each class contains some spots we'd like to finish. They are clearly commented, so you don't have to change any of the existing code.
